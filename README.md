VeinMiner Mod Support
=====================

Provides better mod support than is provided by VeinMiner by default.

Current support:
 * Dartcraft tools with grinding (and possibly smelting).
 * Tinkers Construct tools with auto-smelt
 * Auto-repairs Dartcraft tools with liquid force after each block, so all force is used.
